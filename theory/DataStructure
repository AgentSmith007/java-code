    Bitsets, also called bitmaps, are commonly used as fast data structures. Unfortunately, they can use too much memory.
To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps.

    Roaring bitmaps are compressed bitmaps which tend to outperform conventional compressed bitmaps such as WAH, EWAH or Concise.
In some instances, roaring bitmaps can be hundreds of times faster and they often offer significantly better compression.
They can even be faster than uncompressed bitmaps.
